    "# Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in Section 1, resizing and rescaling digital images are not trivial operations. There are many ways to resize an image, and one of them is Seam Carving.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this method is the content awareness, which enables resizing images while preserving their visual and semantic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will:\n",
    "1. Apply image processing operations as preliminares for later\n",
    "2. Implement Seam Carving using a greedy algorithm\n",
    "3. Implement Seam Carving as taught in lecture with dynamic programming ([original Seam Carving paper](https://faculty.runi.ac.il/arik/scweb/imret/imret.pdf))\n",
    "4. Compare the methods in addition to bilinear scaling (no need to implement)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "* The notebook is just for displaying your implementation, **do not change code in it**. Changing it might cause failure of our grading unit tests. If you want to change minor things, make sure the original one still runs and display results.\n",
    "* In `utils.py` we created a template to `SeamImage`,`GreedySeamImage` and `DPSeamImage` which are classes which you will be implementing. Note that if a function does not raise a `NotImplemented` exception, it is not mandatory to implement, it is just a suggestion.\n",
    "* `SeamImage` class is the parent class of the second two. It implements the common functionalities both methods share (the class attributes may help you to manage the metadata of the algorithms).\n",
    "* `SeamImage` takes an image path and:\n",
    "    - Loads an RGB image of the original shape\n",
    "    - Creates a weighted grayscale image and stores it\n",
    "    - Defines and stores all the required metadata for the Seam Carving algorithm\n",
    "    - Track removed seam and later be able to visualize them\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GreedySeamImage` inherits from `SeamImage`. Its purpose is to:\n",
    "    - Apply Vertical Seam Carving algorithm using a greedy approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* `DPSeamImage` inherits from `SeamImage`. Its purpose is to:\n",
    "    - Precompute all of the needed decisions and costs using matrices\n",
    "    - Apply Vertical Seam Carving algorithm using the precomputed matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both methods should use the **forward-looking** cost for their decision making.\n",
    "* To get full credit, **you are expected to implement the following as efficient as possible**, and get similar runtime as we report below\n",
    "* **Tip**: To apply changes from outsides modules into `ipynb` files, restarting the notebook is required when using JIT (will be introduced later). To prevent this, we recommend that you copy here the code and later test it from outside\n",
    "* When submitting, the notebook must run end to end without any exception raised\n",
    "* **IMPORTANT**: Submission format: **ex01_{submitter first name}\\_{submitter last name}\\_{submitter ID}\\_{partner first name}\\_{partner last name}\\_{partner ID}.zip** containing `Seam Carving Assignment.ipynb` (all cells executed from start to end), the *images* folder and your implemented `utils.py`. Please stick to this exact format! Nore that the name must match the **exact names as on your Moodle**.\n",
    "* Feel free to ask questions on Piazza. We also highly encourage you to answer questions (but not share code!).\n",
    "\n",

    "##### Discussion\n",
    "* DP matrices: pay attention to the DP matrices you calculated. They should give an intuition of the correctness of your implemetions.\n",
    "* Seam Visualization: There are two noticible phenomenons when looking at them: i) Some seams might be corrupted (side to side). Why is it? which type of seams is it likely to occur? ii) The chosen seams tend to avoid \"important\" content.\n",
    "* Greedy vs DP: greedy is much faster, as it does not need to check the entire image for every seam. It makes a decision row-by-row, as opposed to DP which has to create a matrix covering the whole image. However, it comes at a trade-off of rescaling quality, as greedy may create less-optimal seams when it encounters a local minimum. The DP algorithm enables to take the less optimal paths early on, only if it makes an overall better seam.\n",
    "* Rescaling and resizing: It can be seen that Resizing images preserves geometry of objects, which emphasizes the adavantages of the content-awareness of Seam Carving. On the other hand, rescaling modifies existing image pixels and thus might affect its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Conclusion\n",
    "* We have implemented two applications of the Seam Carving algorithms\n",
    "* We have compared Seam Carving to some content-aware methods and discussed their pros/cons\n",
    "* This implementation can be extended into some possible directions:\n",
    "    * Removing objects while keeping the same image size\n",
    "    * Adding objects into images\n",
